 To use ServiceNow on Demisto, ensure your user account has the rest_api_explorer and web_service_admin roles.
 These roles are required to make API calls.
 However, they may not suffice for viewing records in some tables.
 Please make sure you have the correct role so you have permissions to work with the relevant table.
  
### Instance Configuration
The integration supports two types of authorization:
1. Basic authorization using username and password.
2. OAuth 2.0 authorization.

#### OAuth 2.0 Authorization
To use OAuth 2.0 authorization follow the next steps:
1. Login to your service-now instance and create an endpoint for XSOAR to access your instance (please see [Snow OAuth](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-platform-administration/page/administer/security/task/t_CreateEndpointforExternalClients.html) for more information). 
2. Copy the `Client Id` and `Client Secret` (press the lock next to the client secret to reveal it) that were automatically generated when creating the endpoint into the `Username` and `Password` fields of the instance configuration.
3. Check the `Use OAuth` checkbox and click the `Done` button.
4. Run the command `!servicenow-login` from the XSOAR CLI and fill in the username and password of the ServiceNow instance. This step generates an access token to the service-now instance and is required only in the first time after configuring a new instance in the XSOAR platform.
5. (Optional) Test the created instance by running the `!servicenow-test` command.

**Note**
When running the `!servicenow-login` command, a refresh token is generated and will be used to produce new access tokens after the current access token has expired.
